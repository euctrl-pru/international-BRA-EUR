<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> Capacity and Throughput</h1>
<p>A proper balance between airport capacity and flight demand is paramount to an adjusted network flow. This section addresses the capacity and throughput dimensions as measured by a variety of KPIs.</p>
<div id="peak-declared-capacity" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Peak Declared Capacity</h2>
<p>Peak Declared Capacity refers to the highest movement rate (arrivals and landings) at an airport using the most favourable runway configuration under optimal conditions.
The capacity value might be subject to local or national decision-making processes.
The indicator represents the highest number of landings an airport can accept in one-hour time frame.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the peak capacity is determined by DECEA considering local operational constraints.
Within the European region, the airport capacity is determined locally or nationally as part of the capacity declaration process. This considers local operational constraints (e.g. political caps, noise quota and abatement procedures), infrastructure related limitations (e.g. apron/stand availability, passenger facilities). The declaration process considers typically IMC separation minima for runway movements.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>All European airports in this study are Category 3 - fully slot controlled.
The slot and capacity declaration process is undertaken on the local or national level.
Throughout the last years additional political caps in terms of maximum number of annual movements (e.g. Amsterdam (EHAM) movement cap of 500.000 commercial operations) or permissible night and day time restrictions (e.g. London Heathrow night operation cap) have been introduced widely.
Accordingly, capacity values in Europe vary despite the local runway system capabilities.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the last years no substantial change in the declared capacity has been observed at European airports.
In Brazil, on the other hand, 2019 shows a revised capacity declaration for most of the airports throughout the country, c.f. Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:capsovertime">5.1</a>.
Since the end 2018, the CGNA has been working on the enhancement of the methodology applied in Brazil when it comes to the determination of runway capacity.</p>
<p>Previously, there were conservative limitations in the declarations of airports capacity. Capacity was limited to the maximum of 80% of its real value, due to other variables taken into account. The best practice then was the 50%/50% division between arrivals and departures. Nowadays, the process and analysis methodology has evolved in such ways that those mentioned concepts are no longer in use. The capacity is declared in its actual value considering all variables that can restrain the entire declaration of it.
There are no limits in the operations division.
It is applied according to the airport necessity or to the meteorological condition.</p>
<p>These changes significantly increased runway systems capacity for most of Brazilian airports.
Airports such as SBGR, SBGL, SBCF, SBBR and SBSV got the best out of the changes made, once there were important changes in their runway system configurations. CGNA keeps developing enhancements in the runway capacity analysis process.
By the end of 2020, a new document about that new process will be published. It will likely continue to improve the way Brazil analyses and declares its airport capacities.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:peakcapacity">5.2</a> shows the peak declared capacity per hour for each of the study airports in Europe and Brazil.
In general the declared capacity for all airports in Europe exceeds the respective declared capacity in Brazil.</p>
<p>The peak capacity for Brasília (SBBR), Galeão (SBGL), and Guarulhos (SBGR) range about the peak capacity declared for the single-runway airport Gatwick (EGKK). The number at those airports ranges around 50% of the major hubs in Europe, i.e. Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG), Amsterdam (EHAM), and Frankfurt (EDDF).</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the capacity process takes into account a variety of local considerations.
A potential avenue for further research could be a closer investigation of the variances of the declared capacity in line with the local runway system characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="peak-arrival-throughput" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Peak Arrival Throughput</h2>
<p>The peak arrival throughput measures the 95th percentile of the hourly number of landings observed at an airport. The measure gives an indication of the “busy-hour” landing rates. It is an indication to what extent arrival traffic is serviced at an airport. For congested airports, the throughput provides a measure of the effectively realized capacity. Throughput is a measure of demand and comprises already air traffic flow or sequencing measures applied by ATM or ATC in the en-route and terminal phase. For non-congested airports, throughput serves as a measure of showing the level of demand at this airport.</p>

Figure 5.3: Variation of arrival throughput at study airports
</p>
</div>
<!-- change colour/palette - do not waste too much time on it -->
<p>Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:arr-thru">5.3</a> shows a constant behaviour of the peak arrival throughput across the whole time horizon. Noteworthy exemption is Brasilia (SBBR).
At SBBR a reduction of the peak arrival throughput is observed in 2017 in comparison to the previous year.
Brasilia Airport started independent operations on its two runways in 2016.
As a result - and after a period of standardisation of procedures for aircrew and controllers - its traffic was possibly better dispersed through the day, thus reducing peak arrivals from 2017.</p>
<p>For the majority of the European airports, Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:arr-thru">5.3</a> depicts little variation over the years.
These study airports represent the busiest 10 airports and accordingly the peak arrival throughput per hour presents an upper limit based on the airspace user demand and traffic patterns.
The increase observed in peak arrival throughput at Paris (LFPG), Madrid (LEMD), Rome (LIRF), and Munich (EDDM) are in line with additional demand during peak hours.
The continual increase in peak arrival throughput across the last years signals a potential concentration on feeder flights.</p>
<p>The relative constant pattern of the peak arrival throughput observed for many airports suggests that traffic patterns during the busiest hours remained fairly constant.
Potential changes to the airspace user demand have widely occurred outside the peak hours.
This suggests that arrival management of air traffic services in Brazil and Europe is able to sustain the demand.</p>
</div>
<div id="peak-departure-throughput" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Peak Departure Throughput</h2>
<p>In analogy to the arrival throughput, the departure throughput is determined as the 95th percentile of the hourly number of departures. The measure serves as a indication of the “busy-hour” departure rates.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:dep-thru"></span>
<img src="BRA-EUR-comparison_files/figure-html/dep-thru-1.png" alt="Variation of departure throughput at study airports" width="85%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.4: Variation of departure throughput at study airports
</p>
</div>
<p>The peak departure throughput at the study airports shows a similar behaviour than observed for the arrival throughput reported above.
This suggests widely homogenuous demand patterns, i.e. schedules, across the different seasons.</p>
<p>SBBR shows a significant decrease as of 2017, which could also be the result of even distribution of flights after 2016 runway and procedures changes.</p>
<p>In Europe, Rome (LIRF) has seen a drop in 2017 as well, which have then remained fairly constant over the last years, based on a debunking of the outbounds.
Frankfurt (EDDF) and Madrid (LEMD) experienced a step increase in 2018 and 2019 that is in line with additional routes served.
The annual traffic increase observed at Paris (LFPG) is also reflected in an increase in the peak departure throughput accommodating these additional flights also during peak hours.
The systematic constant observed performance at Heathrow (EGLL), Gatwick (EGKK), Barcelona (LEBL), and Zurich (LSZH) evidences that these airports and air traffic services operate at their capacity limits during peak hours.</p>

<div id="declared-capacity-and-peak-throughput" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Declared Capacity and Peak Throughput</h2>
<p>Operational efficiency is driven by the effective utilisation of the deployed capacity during peak times.
In this inital comparison report the difference between the peak arrival rate and its capacity is analysed in order to demonstrate which airports have more and less “slack” between the peak movement and their capacity.
Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:capvsthru">5.5</a> orders all study airports based on their declared arrival capacities and compares these values with the observed peak arrival throughput.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:capvsthru"></span>
<img src="BRA-EUR-comparison_files/figure-html/capvsthru-1.png" alt="Comparison of declared capacity and throughput for arrival phase." width="85%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.5: Comparison of declared capacity and throughput for arrival phase.
</p>
</div>
<p>For the majority of the airports, the approximated arrival capacity is higher than the observed peak throughput.
In Europe, Amsterdam (EHAM), Frankfurt (EDDF), and Munich (EDDM) show a higher peak throughput than the declared capacity. Peak arrival operations at Zurich (LSZH) are slightly higher than the declared capacity.
In Brazil, the realised peak arrival throughput at Sao Paulo (SBSP) exceeds the capacity value as well.
At these airports, it appears that during the peak hours (i.e. the top 5% of all hourly arrivals) better than declared arrival throughputs can be realised.
This might be linked to the methodology of the capacity declaration process that may follow a more modulated approach accounting for a wider varied aircraft mix.
It will be interesting to research in future comparisons how the peak hour demand is managed in comparison to less busier hours and its underlying driving factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="capacity-utilisation" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Capacity Utilisation</h2>
<p>Based on the previous, this section explores level of utilisation of the declared capacity.
The measure aims to display the maximum hourly throughput (UTC hour) across the time horizon and compare it to the declared capacity for the respective airport runway system.
In the current section, the time horizon is the whole year of 2019.
Particularly for this indicator, it is assumed that arrivals and departures account for about 50% of movements over a year.
Thus, the ratio of the observed arrivals to the declared arrival capacity should be broadly consistent with the ratio of total movements (arrivals and departures) and the total declared capacity.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="capacity-and-throughput.html#fig:caputilisation">5.6</a> shows the achieved maximum throughput level vs the declared capacity values.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:caputilisation"></span>
<img src="BRA-EUR-comparison_files/figure-html/caputilisation-1.png" alt="Level of capacity utilisation in 2019." width="85%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.6: Level of capacity utilisation in 2019.
</p>
</div>
<p>The maximum capacity of Brazilian airports tend to be lower than the European airports.
However, the utilised capacity is not that different.
The utilisation rate shows also similarities in terms of banks (arrival peaks) for airports with the arrival utilisation rate significantly higher than the equal share percentage of 50%.
This behaviour is characteristic at airports where dominant airspce users serve departures with inbound feeder flights.
While in Europe utilised capacity ranges from 54% to 69%, in Brazil it goes from only 50% in SBPA, SBCT, and SBGL, up to 78% in SBSP.
SBSP and SBRJ are the Brazilian airports with the most constrained scenarios from that perspective, with capacity utilization at least similar (or above) European airports.
Further exploration of those values is recommended due to the KPI’s assumptions relative to arrivals and departures balance, as stated beforehand.</p>
