<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Efficiency</h1>
<p>Operational efficiency is a critical component in assessing the management and execution of operations.
It provides insights in the management of arrival and departure flows and the associated separation and synchronisation activities.
Inefficiencies can have impact on user operations in terms of experiencing delays or excessive fuel burn.
The measures reported in this study are based on comparing the observed travel time during taxi-out, taxi-in, and during the arrival phase with an associated reference time.
The determined difference (i.e. additional times) measure the level of inefficiencies.
It must be noted that high performance operations will still yield a certain share of measured additional times.
Operational efficiency is therefore aiming at the minimisation of these additional times as they cannot be zero.</p>
<div id="additional-taxi-in-time" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Additional Taxi-In Time</h2>
<p>The additional taxi-in time measures the travel time of an arriving flight from its touchdown (i.e. actual landing time [ALDT]) to its stand/gate position (i.e. actual in-block time [AIBT]). The travel time is compared to a reference time. The reference time is determined for flights arriving at the same runway and/or the same stand/gate position.
The additional time provides a pointer on the management of the outbound traffic.</p>
<p>Due to data availability (i.e. no stand/gate information), the reference times for the Brazilian airports have been computed on the airport level.
It needs to be noted that an aggregation on the airport level may be influenced by the predominant runway and frequently used stand/parking positions. This phenomenon merits further study in one of the future editions.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="efficiency.html#fig:txit">9.1</a> shows the variation of the observed additional taxi-in times.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 9.1: Additional taxi-in time
</p>
</div>
<p>For the majority of Brazilian airports, the average additional taxi-in time ranges at or below 2 minutes per arrival.
For all airports an improvement in terms of reduction of the additional taxi-in time can be observed across the horizon of this report.
Galeão (SBGL), Porto Alegre (SBPA), and Santos Dumont (SBRJ), with an additional taxi-in time ranging around 3 minutes per arrival, exhibit the highest observed taxi-times.</p>
<p>Some factors may have contributed to the reduction in additional taxi-in time over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand reduction after the economic crisis in 2015;</li>
<li>Improved tower and ground control performance due to increased traffic during the 2014 Soccer World Cup;</li>
<li>Infrastructure improvements due to works for major events such as Confederations Cup, Soccer World Cup and Olympics. Many of these works were only completed in the years following the events;</li>
<li>Result of efficiency gains over time after airports were privatized (granted to the private sector); and</li>
<li>Result of efficiency gains with the efforts of Brazilian Aviation community in implementing study groups for operational developments such as AGILE GRU, AGILE RIO, AGILE CAMPINAS and GEPEA (Airspace Planning Study Group).</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of European airports shows a fairly stable average additional taxi-in time.
A high variation across the years is observed at Rome (LIRF) and London Heathrow (EGLL).
At Heathrow, 2018 marks the year of introducing time-based separation on final on a 24hr basis.
In combination with the high share of observed ATFM delay in 2018 and 2019, there is a higher number of aircraft on the surface, which results in longer taxi-in times or holding on the taxiway system.
The threshold of 2 min of additional taxi-in time is also observed for European airports.
Rome (LIRF) ranges at or above 3 min of additional taxi-in time.</p>
<p>In both regions additional taxi-in times around or below 2 minutes per arrival are observed for the majority of study airports.
Higher additional taxi-in times are measured at the busiest and most constrained airports.
Future research may be oriented towards identifying underlying causes driving the observed taxi-in performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-taxi-out-time" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Additional Taxi-Out Time</h2>
<p>In analogy to the previous section, the additional taxi-out time addresses the travel time of a departing aircraft blocking-off at its stand/gate position (i.e. actual off-block time [AOBT]) until the aircraft takes off (i.e. actual take-off time [ATOT]). This travel time is compared to an associated reference time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the taxi-times at Brazilian airports are determined on the airport level.
The inclusion of stand/gate positions is foreseen for future iterations.</p>

<div class="figure"><span id="fig:txot"></span>
<img src="BRA-EUR-comparison_files/figure-html/txot-1.png" alt="Additional taxi-out time" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 9.2: Additional taxi-out time
</p>
</div>
<p>On average the additional taxi-out time varies across the airports in Brazil.
Salvador (SBSV) observes an additional taxi-out time ranging between 7 and 8 minutes in 2018 and 2019.
Taxi-out performance at Curitiba (SBCT) ranges even under 2 minutes per departure.
The average additional taxi-out performance did deteriorate at Porto Alebre (SBPA) between 2016 and 2019.
Conversely, a higher level of performance is observed at Brasília (SBBR).</p>
<p>Brasília (SBBR) may have improved the additional taxi-out time after privatization.
Following the process, a variety of infrastructure and operational improvement programmes had been implemented. This resulted in an enhanced gate use layout, pushback operations and streamlined gate/runway allocation (i.e. reduced taxi distance).
Salvador (SBSV), as already mentioned, was strongly impacted by works at the main taxiway over the last years. At the end of the works, the additional taxi-out time was reduced.</p>
<p>The additional taxi-out time ranges for most of the European airports at or below 4 minutes per departure.
Departing traffic at London Gatwick (EGKK) observe the highest average additional taxi-out time well above 6 minutes per departure with Rome (LIRF) and London Heathrow (EGLL) ranging between 5 and 6 minutes per outbound flight.
These airports also observe an increasing trend for the additional times measured over the last years.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-time-in-terminal-airspace" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Additional Time in Terminal Airspace</h2>
<p>For this comparison report, an initial look at the efficiency of arrival airspace operations has been performed.
Due to data constraints, this use-case analysis addresses the additional time spent in the airspace within 100NM of the study airports in the year 2018.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the additional time in the terminal airspace measures the difference between the excess time of a flight approaching the airport from a specific direction and a reference time based on similar trajectories.
To establish similarity, flights are grouped by entry sector/direction, landing runway, and aircraft type.
The entry sector/direction and landing runway determines the procedural aspects of the arrival.
The aircraft type support to differentiate varying travel and arrival speeds of the aircraft mix observed at the airports.</p>
<p>With a view to establish related reference times, groupings of similar arrival flight profiles have been identified. This identification is based on a visual procedure to identify arrival sectors.
Figure <a href="efficiency.html#fig:asma-hist">9.3</a> shows an example for an airport in Brazil, i.e. SBGR.
In this particular example, marked groups of arrivals from about 320 to 50 degrees have been grouped into one arrival sector.
With the continued technical cooperation between the performance groups in DECEA and EUROCONTROL, the methodology and supporting data processing will be broadened in future reports.</p>

Figure 9.4: Mapping of additional time in arrival airspace to arrival traffic
</p>
</div>
<p>Fig. <a href="efficiency.html#fig:asma-vis">9.4</a> shows several clusters of observed additional times in the terminal airspace.
The lower level of air traffic in the Brazilian region results also in less constrained procedures.
The majority of Brazilian study airports accrue for relative small additional times well below a threshold of 3.5 minutes per arrival.
A similar low level of additional time is observed for EDDM, LFPG, and EDDF in 2018.
As shown above, SBGR shows similar traffic levels to LSZH and LIRF.
For this triplet, an additional time of about 4 minutes per arrival have been observed in 2018.
This signals a similar level of traffic and associated arrival separation and synchronisation techniques.
Within the European context, EGLL exhibits a relatively high additional time in terminal airspace of above 7 minutes per arrival.
This is due to the operational concept applied at EGLL entailing aircraft to be loaded into stacks to ensure continuous pressure on the arrival runway.</p>
