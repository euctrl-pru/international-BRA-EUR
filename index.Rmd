```
</a>
</div>

* **Part B - initial comparison report**: The initial comparison report describes the operational performance in Brazil and Europe for the years 2016-2019. It is based on a selected subset of the ICAO GANP key performance indicators. It is planned that the rolling update of Part A will successively develop into the next iteration of the comparison report.

Previous reports will be available via this page for download.
